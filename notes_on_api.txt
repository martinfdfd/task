1) API/Backend/Frontend takes credit even if fails to start analysis (monetization of api with backwards causality)
2) Task is wrong in claiming that brisbane area is free. Some parts are, but mostly it is not. Getting quite often errors with "Not enough credit"
3) API returns 424 quite often
4) impossible to understand spaceknow api without reverse-engineering frontend. Initiation is required
5) No documentated steps in documentation, lack of examples
6) strange way how to reconstruct images from tiles - not even documented in documentation. Frontend during reconstruction sends hundreds of requests for different tiles of different zoom and around 95% fails with permission denied. Seems like there is no way how to guess correct tiles
